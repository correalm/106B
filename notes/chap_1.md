1. Prepare a source file;

2. Comments are marked with //;

3. The notation with <> indicates that header file is system library. When use "" notation, this indicates that header file comes from
   a custom header file.

4. The constant can be defined as `const double CENTIMETERS_PER_INCH = 2.54`;

5. The `main` function. When the program executes with success returns 0 and other nunmber in case of fail;

6. Ensure that next line is a new line on console;

7.
    name: The name of the variable.
    type: data type of variable. Inidicates the type of data that can be stored on the varibla (int, double, long, etc)

8. a, b, c, f, h, i, k, l

9. Domain and set of operations. Domain is the set of values that belong to that type and set of operations defines the behavior;

10. The difference between these integer types is the size of their domains;

11. ASCII maps the chars to integer values;

12. `true` and `false`;

13. `cin >> x`;

14. `std::cout << "i: " << i << std::endl
     << "d: " << d << std::endl
     << "c: " << c << std::endl
     << "s: " << s << std::endl;`

15.
    a. 2 + 3 = int 5
    b. 19 / 5 = int 3
    c. 19.0 / 5 = float 3.8
    d. 3 * 6.0 = float 18.0
    e. 19 % 5 = int 4
    f. 2 % 7 = int 2

16. unary minus indicates the signal of an operation. Is set on an single number. Subtraction operator is used in a expression,
    with number on both side.

17. **truncation** is the operation of consider only the integer on an division, witch means, discard the decimal part.

18. type cast is a explicit conversion from an type to another.

19.
    a. 4
    b. 2
    c. 42
    d. 42

20. can be `+=`, `-=`, `/=` or `*=`

21. The ++x operator increments the value of `x` before use. The x++ use the value of `x` and after increases its value.

22. Is the evaluation that stops as soon the result is known. As exemple: `true || false` or `false && true`

23. if (condition) {}; switch (condition) case value; while (condition) {}; for (start_value; condition; step) {}

24. Given a value, match this value with each of condition. Case the value satifies some condition, execute the body of this condition.
    When find the `break` keyword stop the interation and pass to next statement

25. 
    a. for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
    b. for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 7)
    c. for (int i = 100; i >= 0; i--)
